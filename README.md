Header and Includes
The header section includes necessary copyright information and includes various headers required for the application:

main.h and cmsis_os.h for STM32 and FreeRTOS functionality.
FreeRTOS.h, task.h, and semphr.h for FreeRTOS API functions.
Private Variables
The code defines several private variables:

defaultTaskHandle for the default FreeRTOS task handle.
htim2 for the TIM2 peripheral handle.
Variables x and y for general-purpose use.
gtimestamp1 and gtimestamp2 as volatile variables for timestamping.
Task and Semaphore Definitions
prv_obj structure to store task information like task_id, hw_led (hardware LED pin), task_period, and task_offset.
Mutex_Handle_t for a semaphore handle to ensure mutual exclusion.
obj1 and obj2 for task-specific objects.
Main Function
The main function initializes the HAL, sets up the system clock, initializes peripherals (GPIO and TIM2), and creates tasks with xTaskCreate. The tasks vTask_Re, vTask1, and vTask2 are created with their respective settings. A mutex is created with xSemaphoreCreateMutex, and the TIM2 peripheral is started.

Task Functions
vTask_Re: This task toggles an LED every task_period milliseconds and prints the current iteration, task ID, and timestamp. It uses a mutex to ensure that the print operation is thread-safe.
vTask1: A simple task that toggles an LED and runs a delay loop.
vTask2: Similar to vTask1, it toggles another LED and runs a delay loop.
FreeRTOS Hooks
vApplicationMallocFailedHook: Called if a memory allocation fails.
vApplicationStackOverflowHook: Called if a task overflows its stack.
Peripheral Initialization Functions
SystemClock_Config: Configures the system clock.
MX_TIM2_Init: Initializes TIM2.
MX_GPIO_Init: Configures GPIO pins.
Reentrancy in the Code
Reentrancy is managed in the vTask_Re function using a mutex. The xSemaphoreTake and xSemaphoreGive functions ensure that only one task can print to the console at a time, preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety.

GPIO Initialization
The MX_GPIO_Init function initializes GPIO pins PB1 and PB2 as output pins and sets their initial state to high.

Error Handling
Error_Handler: A generic error handler that disables interrupts and enters an infinite loop.
assert_failed: Reports the file name and line number where an assert error occurred.
